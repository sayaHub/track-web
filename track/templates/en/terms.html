        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>This page (taken with the documents and pages it refers to) tells you the terms of use which you agree to when you use the https-everywhere.canada.ca website and any associated services described below (the web services).</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">General terms of use</h2>
		<p class="mb-4">By using the website and its web services, you indicate that you accept these Terms and Conditions and that you agree to abide by them. If you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions please refrain from using the website and its web services.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You agree to use the web services only for lawful purposes and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of, this site by any third party. Additionally, you must not misuse the web services by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the web services, the server on which they are stored or any server, computer or database connected to the web services. You must not attack the web services via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of-service attack. Any breach of this provision may be reported to the relevant law enforcement authorities and where necessary we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">HTTPS Dashboard Operation</h2>
		
		<p class="mb-4">The information within the HTTPS Dashboard is presented to assist in the planning and prioritization of departments’ HTTPS efforts, and monitor department compliance to ITPIN 2018-01, specifically if websites are configured as per the direction in the ITPIN. The HTTPS Dashboard provides a consolidated view of the configuration status of GC external websites based on public domain information.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The Dashboard together with the implementation guides were designed to provide general guidance to IT practitioners; however, in some cases, additional information or steps may be required.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You will not provide personal information to the HTTPS Dashboard. All information provided for use in the Dashboard is done so in alignment with TBS Digital Transformation Office requirements regarding the management and registration of web domains. All information regarding the registration of Government of Canada domains is held and managed by the TBS Digital Transformation Office (<a href="mailto:dto.btn@tbs-sct.gc.ca">dto.btn@tbs-sct.gc.ca</a>).</p>
        <p class="mb-4">To improve the functionality of Government of Canada websites, certain files (such as open source libraries, images and scripts) may be delivered automatically to your browser via a trusted third-party server or content delivery network. The delivery of these files is intended to provide a seamless user experience by speeding response times and avoiding the need for each visitor to download these files. Where applicable, specific privacy statements covering these files are included in our Privacy Notice.</p> 
  
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Privacy Notice</h2>
        
        <p class="mb-4">The Government of Canada and Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada are committed to providing Web sites that respect the privacy of visitors. This privacy notice summarizes the privacy practices for Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada's online activities.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">All personal information collected by this institution is governed by the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Privacy Act</a>. This means that if applicable you will be informed of the purpose for which any personal information is being collected and how to exercise your right of access to that information.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Your privacy and the Internet</h2>
     
        <p class="mb-4">The nature of the Internet is such that web servers automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including the visitor’s Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, we consider the IP address to be personal information, particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when visitor requests a web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of the visit.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Unless otherwise noted, we do not automatically gather any specific information from you, such as your name, telephone number or email address. We would obtain this type of information only if you supply it to us, for example, by email or by filling in a contact form. In such cases, how your personal information is handled will be provided in a Personal Information Collection Statement.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">In cases where services are provided by organizations outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms or mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the web server of the third-party service provider.</p>
   
        <h2 class="mb-4">Communicating with the Government of Canada</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">If you choose to send Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada an e-mail or complete a feedback form online, Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada uses your personal information to respond to your inquiry. The information you provide will only be shared with another government institution if your inquiry relates to that institution. Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada does not use the information to create individual profiles nor does it disclose the information to anyone other than those in the federal government who need to provide you with a response. Any disclosure of your personal information is in accordance with the Privacy Act.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Emails and other electronic methods used to communicate with the Government of Canada are not secure unless it is specifically stated on a Web page. Therefore, it is recommended that you do not send sensitive personal information, such as your Social Insurance Number or your date of birth, through non-secure electronic means.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Personal information from emails or completed feedback forms is collected pursuant to the Financial Administration Act and the Canada Border Services Agency Act. Such information may be used for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes and is included in <a href="https://www.infosource.gc.ca/emp/emp03-eng.asp#psu914" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Personal Information Bank Public Communications (PSU 914)</a>.</p>
    
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Providing content in Canada’s official languages</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">The <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Official Languages Act</a>, the <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-92-48/index.html" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Official Languages (Communications with and Services to the Public) Regulations</a> and Treasury Board policy requirements establish when we use both English and French to provide services to or communicate with members of the public. When there is no obligation to provide information in both official languages, content may be available in one official language only. Information provided by organizations not subject to the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/O-3.01/" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Official Languages Act</a> is in the language(s) provided. Information provided in a language other than English or French is only for the convenience of our visitors.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Improving your Experience on Government of Canada Web sites</h2>

        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Digital Markers (including cookies)</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">A digital marker is a resource created by the visitors' browser in order to remember certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same or subsequent visit to the Web site. Examples of digital markers are cookies or HTML5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="mb-4">
            <li>they allow a Web site to recognize a previous visit each time the visitor accesses the site;</li>
            <li>they track what information is viewed on a site which helps Web site administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada uses sessional and persistent digital markers on some portions of its Web site. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada's Web server. The digital markers used do not allow Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada to identify individuals.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada's Web site.</p>
        
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Web Analytics</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">Web analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about Web traffic and visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage. Information in digital markers may be used for the purpose of web analytics to remember your online interactions with Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada’s website.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada uses Google Analytics to improve its web site. When your computer requests a Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada Web page, our institution collects the following types of information for Web analytics:</p>
        <ul class="mt-4 mb-4">
            <li>the originating IP address</li>
            <li>the date and time of the request</li>
            <li>the type of browser used</li>
            <li>the page(s) visited</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="mb-4">The information collected is disclosed to Google, an external third party service provider. Your IP address is anonymized prior to being stored on the service provider's servers in order to help safeguard your privacy. The information collected is de-personalized by activating the anonymization feature in Google Analytics.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Data collected for Web analytics purposes goes outside of Canada to the United States of America and may be subject to the governing legislation of that country, such as the USA PATRIOT Act.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Information used for the purpose of Web analytics is collected pursuant to the Financial Administration Act. Such data may be used for communications and information technology statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting. For more information on how your privacy is safeguarded in relation to web analytics, see the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?section=text&id=26761" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Standard on Privacy and Web Analytics</a>.</p>
   
        <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4">Protecting the Security of Government of Canada Web sites</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. This software receives and records the IP address of the computer that has contacted our Web site, the date and time of the visit and the pages visited. We make no attempt to link these addresses with the identity of individuals visiting our site unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">This information is collected pursuant to section <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-11/page-69.html#docCont" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">161 of the Financial Administration Act</a>. The information may be shared with appropriate law enforcement authorities if suspected criminal activities are detected. Such information may be used for network security statistical purposes, audit, evaluation, research, planning and reporting and is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="https://www.infosource.gc.ca/emp/emp03-eng.asp#psu939" target="_blank" class="text-https-blue hover:text-black">Security Incidents (PSU 939)</a>.</p>
